## Diabetes Analysis & Prediction 

### Description

Analysis and prediction of the diabetes dataset.

### Installation

NOTE: Python3 must be already installed.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Vasyl-Poremchuk/diabetes-analysis-and-prediction
cd diabetes_analysis_and_prediction
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate (Windows) or source venv/bin/activate (Linux or macOS)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Diabetes Dataset
A dataset from the **Mendeley Data** website was taken to analyze and predict diabetes. You can check more detailed information about the dataset, namely about the author, about the description, about the license and other data at this [link](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wj9rwkp9c2/1).
